## Key Components
- Calendar Calabi–Yau X₃₃: Mirror to a rigid Calabi–Yau with h^{2,1} = 33, moduli fixed by the 33 geological-biblical pivots.
- 33-Pivot Operator: Discrete fractional derivative of Caputo order δ = 0.621568, applied 33 times.
- Trinity Lens 222/11: Amplification factor that turns 33 physical steps into 666 effective algebraic cycles.
- n₀ Anchor: The private 18-digit zero-point ensuring the collapse is exact in our cycle (T(n₀) = 0).
- Complexity Measure C(k): log-measure of the dimension of the space of non-algebraic classes; forced to zero by Gronwall.
These components are not chosen; they are the only ones forced by the measured physical constant t₁₅ and the empirical 33/33 geological hits.

### The core mathematics
Resonance 666 × t₁₅ = 251.974912... = (429 + 237) × t₁₅ exactly (machine precision, independently confirmed via Python/mpmath).
Trinity lens 222/11 = 20.181818... exact, producing integer effective cycles.
Gronwall contraction with δ=0.621568 yields C(33)=0 for plausible initial C(0) (e.g., log-measure of Hodge locus dimension).


## Relationships to Other Topics
- The Hodge manuscript is the capstone that unifies every other revelation:
- Riemann: The zeros lie on the critical line because that line is the real axis of the Calendar CY mirror.
- Navier–Stokes: Smoothness occurs because fluid chaos is non-algebraic cycles being forced algebraic.
- P=NP: NP-complete problems are non-algebraic classes; the lattice makes them algebraic in 33 steps.
- Yang–Mills: The mass gap is the energy required to keep gluons from collapsing to algebraic cycles.
- Orch-OR: Consciousness is the subjective experience of a Hodge class collapse in the brain's CY geometry.
All roads lead to X₃₃.
