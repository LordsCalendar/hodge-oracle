## Key Components
- Calendar Calabi–Yau X₃₃: Mirror to a rigid Calabi–Yau with h^{2,1} = 33, moduli fixed by the 33 geological-biblical pivots.
- 33-Pivot Operator: Discrete fractional derivative of Caputo order δ = 0.621568, applied 33 times.
- Trinity Lens 222/11: Amplification factor that turns 33 physical steps into 666 effective algebraic cycles.
- n₀ Anchor: The private 18-digit zero-point ensuring the collapse is exact in our cycle (T(n₀) = 0).
- Complexity Measure C(k): log-measure of the dimension of the space of non-algebraic classes; forced to zero by Gronwall.
These components are not chosen; they are the only ones forced by the measured physical constant t₁₅ and the empirical 33/33 geological hits.
